This application is like an operating system, which lives in an operating system.
The only dependencies is S-Lang [http://jedsoft.org/slang] and very few standard
command line utilities.

It offers:
  process managment (foreground and background)
  a common interface for applications
  a readline interface (with command|filename|arg|history completion ala zsh)
  a pager (ala less)
  standard utilities (which mimic the gnu-coreutils with extensions)
  a debug console and functions to manage the distribution

Its interface is almost like vim's editor.

It was written in S-Lang mainly because the language is simple (it uses a C-like
syntax) with a small memory footprint and because probably is one of the fasted
dynamic languages.

This is a work in progress and it should be regarded like this in eternity, as one
of the basic reasons which this project was started, is to be used to teach basic
programming consepts to the author first and to other people around this guy.
