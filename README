This application is like an operating system, which lives in an operating system.
The only dependencies is S-Lang [http://jedsoft.org/slang] and very few standard
command line utilities.

It offers:
  process managment (foreground and background)
  a common interface for applications
  a readline interface (with command|filename|arg|history completion ala zsh)
  a pager (ala less)
  standard utilities (which mimic the gnu-coreutils with extensions)
  a debug console and functions to manage the distribution

Its interface is almost like vim's editor.

It was written in S-Lang mainly because the language is simple (it uses a C-like
syntax) with a small memory footprint and because probably is one of the fasted
dynamic languages.

This is a work in progress and it should be regarded like this in eternity, as one
of the basic reasons which this project was started, is to be used to teach basic
programming concepts to the author first and to other people around this guy.

INSTALLATION

# REQUIRED dependencies:
# ps from procps-ng
# stty from coreutils
# sudo
# libpcre (libs and headers)
# libcurl (lib and header)

# optionally
# to display man pages
# col from util_linux
# groff
# gzip

# open a shell and enter the following commands

# optionally:
# mkdir gitrepos
# cd gitrepos

# This application always follows S-Lang development, so it wont work
# with a standard release, so
# clone S-Lang repository

git clone git://git.jedsoft.org/git/slang.git &&

# build distribution
cd slang
# by default prefix is /usr/local, so leave it there as it doesn't contadicts
# with another libslang installed by a package manager

./configure &&
# check if picked up pcre, otherwise install pcre headers and libs and rerun
# configure
make &&
sudo make install &&
# run ldconfig
sudo ldconfig -v

# install curl module
git clone git://git.jedsoft.org/git/slcurl.git
cd slcurl
./configure &&
# check for any errors, namely a missing curl header
make &&
sudo make install

# Now make a dir to store the sources for this application
mkdir somedir
cd somedir

# IMPORTANT NOTE: it should be sources for the name of the repo,
# otherwise nothing will work
git clone https://github.com/agh-xx/youandit.git sources
ln -sv sources/me/I_Ns/you.sl

# create the personal hierarchy
mkdir -p sources/she/modules
mkdir sources/she/data
mkdir sources/she/data/bytecompile
mkdir -p sources/she/functions/scripts
mkdir sources/she/functions/data
mkdir sources/she/functions/info
mkdir sources/she/types
mkdir sources/she/lib
mkdir -p sources/she/commands/scripts
mkdir sources/she/commands/info

# End of installation commands

# PREREQUISITY to make sudo work properly and it wont break the application
# sudo it closes all file integer descriptors above stderr

# so add the following three lines to your sudoers
# replace USER with your username

Defaults:USER closefrom_override 
Defaults:USER !tty_tickets 
Defaults:USER timestamp_timeout=1

# Now run
/usr/bin/local/slsh ./you.sl
